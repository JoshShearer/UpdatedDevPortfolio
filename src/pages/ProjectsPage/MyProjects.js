    keyLessons:
      "This is an ongoing company that I am building from scratch.  I am currently the sole developer and have been working on it for about 6 months.  I have learned a lot about the process of building a company and the challenges that come with it.  I have also learned a lot about team building, leadership, networking, and communication.  The LoopString Platform is providing automation as a service to help small and medium businesses automate their business processes.  The platform is built on a microservice architecture and is designed to be highly scalable and secure.  LoopString is currently in beta and is being used by several businesses.",

    notableLibraries: "Material UI",
    projectOverview:
      "This is a full stack web app that was designed to be easily portable to mobile platforms via react-native.  This is a simple app meant to allow people to capture their thoughts while traveling and associate them with the locations they occurred.",
    keyLessons:
      "This was a challenging and pivotal project.  It taught me about all the intricasies of the react front-end especially as it relates to state management.  Additionally, I learned what really goes into creating a backend for data storage and aquisition.",

    skills: "Web 3, Heroku, Blockchain, Redux/Rematch",
    toolset: "Javscript, React, Nextjs, Typescript, Solidity, Truffle, Ganache",
    notableLibraries: "Nextjs, Typescript, Redux/Rematch, Tailwindui, Headwindui, Solidity",
    projectOverview: "This is built with a Nextjs/Typescript front-end.  It will pull in HD Account data via the metamask add-in in the browser.  The exchange will execute deposit/withdraw and buy/sell orders for the local MTB Token with ETH.  Contracts are written in solidity.",
    keyLessons:
      "This project is was a great opportunity to learn modern front end build stacks and incorporate code reliability via typescript, in addition to getting great experience in using and writing web 3 contracts in solidity.  I found that Solidity has a great testing library that I was able to utilize in order to reduce contract bugs, making them more robust and reliable.",

    skills:
      "Beer Making, Procurement, Fabrication, Soldering, Electrical Design, Automation",
    toolset: "Python, Raspberry Pi 4, Linux",
    notableLibraries: "Craft Beer Pi 3",
    projectOverview: "This was a great project that ended up automating the brewing process and allowed me to really hone in on the recipe process and make the great beer in a repeatable and reliable way.  Those great brews are no longer at the behest of chance occurances and minute differences in the recipe that might vary slightly in the manual process.",
    keyLessons:
      "This project proved very challenging in the breadth required for completion.  Hardware design & procurement, soldiering, fabricating, high and low voltage design as well as knowledge of Python in addition to sensor data verification and aquisition were all required to get this system up and running.",

    title: "Nutrition Macro Transfer",
    skills:
      "WebScraping, Automated Data Aquisition and Entry",
    toolset: "Python",
    notableLibraries: "Selenium, Pandas",
    projectOverview: "This project allowed me to port several years of nutritional macro data from MyFitnessPal to Cronometer.  There was no tools at the time to do this.  I was able to learn and combine several tools to take .csv data exported from MyFitnessPal and input the meal macro data via automated navigation software (selenium) into Cronometer.  Cronometer was a newer nutritional tracking app that was capable of tracking more macro data.  For this it was prefered. After years of waiting for a tool to import, I decided I would write some code to accomplish it.  This project proved very challenging as the tools are functional but not always reliable and sometimes at the whim of page loading times or internet speed.  In addition to the macro nutrient data, I imported all biometric data from sources like wellnessfx.com.",
    keyLessons:
      "Selenium is a great automation tool, but can be very particular in accessing data and waiting on pages to load.  The design process required the assumption that the script would break and need to restart at random intervals.",

    title: "Glucose Monitoring",
    skills: "WebScraping, Data Entry Automation",
    toolset: "Python, Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, Bokeh ",
    notableLibraries: "Pandas",
    projectOverview: "This project was meant to learn more about my body and how it specifically processes different sources or glucose (sugar).  I used a Dexcom G5 sensor and xDrip to gather and log the raw CGM data.  I then used several Python tools to generate visual aids for viewing and understanding how my body reacts to glucose.  These responses include amplitude and rate of spikes and troughs, how it relates to food eaten and whether exercise occurred slightly before or after the meal.  I was able to utilize these visual aids to see how Food, Glucose, Exercise and Sleep all interact to better understand and minimize glucose spikes in my body.",
    keyLessons:
      "This project ended up being much more time consuming that expected.  It allowed me to really learn the power of tools like Pandas and Numpy for data processing and Bokeh and Matplot lib for visualizing the data.  Numpy and pandas are quite impressive for raw data processing.  The tools really make it easy to process very large, complicated datasets.",
